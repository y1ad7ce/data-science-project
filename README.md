This analysis focuses on finding the relationship between rainfall and reservoir water level. 

This only contains the analysis part of the project which I've been writing.
Please refer to the other directory for our complete team effort. 

The ANOVA shows differences in means are very significant. Yet, in my residual plots non-normality was present. This is also reflected in the linear regressions which result low p-values and low R-squares. 

Conclusion: Rainfall does affect water level in some ways. However, there are unexplainable variations, shown by the residual analysis and low R-square in linear regression, meaning we urgently require much more factors to be taken into consideration. 

Some ideas for what to look for: temperature, humidity levels, water evaporation rates, water inflow and water outflow
